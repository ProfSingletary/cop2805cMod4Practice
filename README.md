Write a program which uses HashSets to count and display vowels and consonants in response to an input string from the user. 
Assume A, E, I, O, and U are the vowels. The same vowels or consonants are counted only once. The letters are case-insensitive.

Sample run:

  Enter a string: Programming is fun
  The number of vowels is 4
  The number of consonants is 7
